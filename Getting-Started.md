### Overview
IoT.js is built based on JerryScript(lightweight JavaScript engine) and libuv for asynchronous I/O event handling.

#### Source repositories
* IoT.js: https://github.com/Samsung/iotjs.git
* JerryScript: https://github.com/Samsung/jerryscript.git
* libuv: https://github.com/Samsung/libuv-iotjs.git 

### Supported platforms 
Current supported platforms are **Linux and NuttX**

* [Build for Linux](https://github.com/Samsung/iotjs/wiki/Build-for-Linux): Ubuntu 14.04 is used as a base platform.
* [Build for NuttX](https://github.com/Samsung/iotjs/wiki/Build-for-NuttX): NuttX 7.9 2eba8afab5e8bdcïœ«32a0f6365de070eaa7f383149 (Feb 15, 2015) is used with iotjs specific patches.
