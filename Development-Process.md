It is the responsibility of IoT.js _committers_ to decide whether submitted code should be integrated into the master branch, returned for revision, or rejected.

Individual developers maintain a local copy of the IoT.js codebase using the git revision control system. Git ensures that all participants are working with a common and up-to-date code base at all times. Each developer works to develop, debug, build, and validate their own code against the current codebase, so that when the time comes to integrate into the master branch of the project, their changes apply cleanly and with a minimum amount of merging effort.

The IoT.js Project development process is marked by the following highlights:
* The feature development process starts with an author discussing a proposed feature with the _committers_
* The _committers_ evaluate the idea, give feedback, and finally approve or reject the proposal.
* The author shares the proposal with the community via _github issues with 'new feature' label_
* The community provides feedback which can be used by the author to modify their proposal and share it with the community again.
* The above steps are repeated until the community reaches a consensus according to the Community Guidelines.
* After a consensus is reached, the author proceeds with the implementation and testing of the feature.
* After the author is confident their code is ready for integration:
  - The author generates a patch and signs off on their code.
  - The author submits a patch by [opening a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#pr).
* The _committers_ watch the pull request for the patch, test the code, and accept or reject the patch accordingly.
* After the code passes code review, the _committers_ accept the code(integrated into the master branch), which completes the development process.
* After a patch has been accepted, it remains the authoring developer's responsibility to maintain the code throughout its lifecycle, and to provide security and feature updates as needed.
