## Project Roles

#### Contributor

#### Committer

#### Maintainer

#### Selection of Committers and Maintainers

A candidate for the Committer role should be one of the Contributors who has submitted at least 10 non-trivial patches in project and has shown characteristics consistent with the requirements of the Committer role. 
A candidate for the Maintainer role should be one of the Committers. 
To be a candidate for the Committer or Maintainer, a Contributor can self-nominate with proper evidences.

The selection process should be achieved by consensus of the Contributors active in. If consensus cannot be achieved, Maintainers will make the decision by voting.

#### Selection of Committers/Maintainers Status

A Maintainer or a Committer who intentionally abused his review privilege may have it temporarily suspended on the request of other Committers or Maintainers. Committers and Maintainers not including the person under consideration should discuss on the revocation of the person. If consensus cannot be reached, Maintainers will make the decision by voting.

## Decision Making Process

Decisions in the IoT.js project are made always at the lowest level possible that is applicable for the decision in question. Decision makers always need to keep in mind the rules of community and the IoT.js goals and roadmap.

* Individual Contributors are making decisions every time they submit changes in the form of deciding what to implement and how to go about it.
* Two or more Contributors also make decisions when participating in discussions in community, on bug or feature reports, in reviewing of commits. Their arguments in why a given decision should be made are part of the consensus that needs to be reached for the decision. At this level, the principle of meritocracy is important, as the opinion of those who have contributed more will be given more weight in the consensus-building.
* If those Contributors cannot agree and reach consensus on a decision, then IoT.js provides for decisions to be made by Maintainers following their own decision-making process, avoiding stalemates.
