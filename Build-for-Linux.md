### Overall steps to build for Linux
1. Get the sources
2. Set build options
3. Build all at once


***


#### Build Host
Ubuntu 14.04 is recommended. Other Unix like platforms can be used. If it doesn't seem to work properly on other platforms, please look into [Issues](https://github.com/Samsung/iotjs/issues). Someone may have already tried. If you can't find any related one, please leave an issue for help.

#### Directory structure

This document assumes 'harmony' as the root directory. _JerryScript_ and _libuv_ are included as sub-modules in deps folder.

* harmony
    * iotjs
        * deps
            * jerry
            * libuv

â€» harmony? It's from initial code name of our project. (_Sounds good, isn't it? :)_)

#### Prerequisite

You need to install some packages to build IoT.js, as follows;

```
sudo apt-get install gyp cmake build-essential
```

gcc/g++ compiler 4.8 and upper versions are required to compile. If you have any problems upgrading to 4.8, please google. One of those helped me is [how-to-install-gcc-4-8](http://askubuntu.com/questions/271388/how-to-install-gcc-4-8).


### 1. Get the sources

Clone our repository to look around and test it. If it attracts you and want to try something interests, please fork it.

To get the source for this repository, 
```
cd harmony
git clone https://github.com/Samsung/iotjs.git
cd iotjs
```

Sub modules(_jerryscript_ and _libuv_) will be pulled. And matching hash will be checked out for your current IoT.js version when you run the build script.


### 2. Set build options

Some basic options are provided.

Existing build options are listed as follows;
```
buildtype=release|debug (release is default)
builddir=build (build is default)
buildlib (default is false)
target-arch=x86_64|i686|arm (depends on your host platform)
target-os=linux|nuttx (linux is default)
make-flags=-j9 (options to send to make)
nuttx-home= (no default value)
```

Options that may need explanations.
* builddir: compile intermediate and output files are generated here. 
* buildlib: generating _iotjs_ to a library if true(e.g. for NuttX) it doesn't need value. _--buildlib_ is same as '--buildlib=true'.
* nuttx-home: it's NuttX platform specific, to tell where the NuttX configuration and header files are.

To give options, please use two dashes '--' before the option name as described in following sections.
 

### 3. Build all at once

IoT.js and required sub-modules are generated all at once in tools folder with build.py.

```
cd iotjs
./tools/build.py
```

#### Options example

It's a good practice to build in separate folder, like 'build'. IoT.js generates all outputs into separate **'build'** folder. You can change this by --builddir option. Usually you won't need to use this option. Target and architecture name are used as a name for a folder inside 'build' folder.

To build debug version and results to 'output' folder
```
./tools/build.py --buildtype=debug --builddir=output
```

If you want to build 32bit version in x86_64 and debug only a library,
```
./tools/build.py --target-arch=i686 --buildtype=debug --buildlib
```

#### Build only _iotjs_ with given build option

If you had some modification and build only IoT.js this explains how. IoT.js uses [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) for makefile generation. You can go inside the build folder and just build with 'make' command. Go inside where your target platform name, for example x86_64 linux,
```
cd build/x86_64-linux/iotjs
make
```

#### How to execute?

Executable name is **'iotjs'** and resides in (target-arch)-(target-os)/iotjs. To run greetings JavaScript in test folder for example,

```
./build/x86_64-linux/iotjs/iotjs ./test/hello_iot.js
```

#### What build script does

1. It will clone submodules jerryscript and libuv, this is done only once when version hash has not changed.
2. Checkout matching version for each submodules.
3. Build submodules, you can see the outputs at build/(target-arch)-(target-os)/libs folder.
4. Build iotjs


#### How to clean

Just remove the folder like
```
rm -rf build
```
or it you want to clean for rebuild one submodule, for example libuv
```
rm -rf build/x86_64-linux/deps/libuv
```
